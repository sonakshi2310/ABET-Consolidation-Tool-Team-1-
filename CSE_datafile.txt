These program criteria apply to engineering programs that include “systems” or “and systems” in their titles, with the exception of those that use the word “systems” with a direct modifier, such as mechanical systems, biological systems, control systems, etc.
1. Curriculum
The structure of the curriculum must provide both breadth and depth across the range of engineering topics implied by the title of the program.
The curriculum must include the following topics:
Advanced mathematics, including probability and statistics, and computing fundamentals, with practical applications thereof.
Engineering topics necessary to define, synthesize, analyze, design, and evaluate complex systems containing hardware and software, and human elements (where appropriate), in a holistic manner across the lifecycle.
Systems design and analysis topics, such as decision analysis, risk analysis (cost, schedule, and performance), trade-off analysis, optimization, modeling based engineering, simulation, sensitivity analysis techniques, or requirements engineering.
2. Faculty
The program shall demonstrate that those faculty members teaching courses that are primarily design in content are qualified to teach the subject matter by virtue of education and experience or professional licensure.
