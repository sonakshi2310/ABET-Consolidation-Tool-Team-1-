Proposed Program Criteria for Manufacturing and Similarly Named Engineering Programs
Lead Society: Society of Manufacturing Engineers
These program criteria apply to engineering programs that include “manufacturing” and similar modifiers in their titles.
1. Curriculum
The program must include curricular content in the following areas:

materials and manufacturing processes: design of products, manufacturing processes, and systems that result in products that meet specific design intent, material, life cycle, and other requirements;
process, assembly and product engineering: utilizing modern engineering equipment, tooling, and environment necessary for their manufacture;
manufacturing competitiveness: creation of competitive advantage through advanced manufacturing technologies, manufacturing planning, strategy, quality, and control;
manufacturing systems design: analyze, synthesize, and control manufacturing operations using statistical methods; and
manufacturing laboratory or facility experience: measurement of manufacturing process input variables, analysis of output responses, and development of technical inferences about the process.

The culminating major design experience must address a manufacturing engineering problem.
2. Faculty
The program must demonstrate that faculty members maintain currency in manufacturing engineering practice.
